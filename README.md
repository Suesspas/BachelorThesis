This platform game serves as a test bed for simulating neuroevolution in a physics-based environment. 
It is coded in Java with the use of the [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/) library.

Different levels during simulation:
Level 1:

(Basic level with four platforms, one goal (big platform to the right) and multiple bots trying to reach the goal. The current velocities which are exerted on the
bots are shown by the red vectors.)



Level 2 and 3:
